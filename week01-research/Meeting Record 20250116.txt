# Meeting Record January 16, 2025

### Discussion Summary

This meeting focused on assigning team members to select their preferred game options (based on the options listed in the presentation) for research. Each member is tasked with compiling their research findings and personal reflections into a **report**. These reports will serve as the basis for deciding the theme, game type, and game elements for development.

**Deadline:** Please upload your report to **Github** by Sunday.

### Development Strategy

The current idea is to build upon the mechanics of existing games, then add new elements and features. This approach aims to streamline the development process and avoid unnecessary complexity.

Additionally, all members are encouraged to explore the limitations of using **p5.js** for game development. It is recommended to visit [**p5play**](https://p5play.org/play/) to review examples of games developed with p5.js and gain inspiration from others' projects.
