GAME ONE : Protect the Carrot

-1- game rules
Basic Rules: Players need to build defense towers to protect the carrot and prevent monsters from reaching the end point from the starting point. The defense towers attack the monsters on the path, gradually reducing their health points. After the monsters are eliminated, players can obtain gold coins, which are used to build or upgrade defense towers.
Victory Condition: All monsters are eliminated and the carrot is still alive (with ten health points).
Defeat Condition: The monsters reach the carrot and the carrot's health points are depleted.
