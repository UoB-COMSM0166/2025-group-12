GAME ONE : Protect the Carrot

I. game rules
Basic Rules: Players need to build defense towers to protect the carrot and prevent monsters from reaching the end point from the starting point. The defense towers attack the monsters on the path, gradually reducing their health points. After the monsters are eliminated, players can obtain gold coins, which are used to build or upgrade defense towers.
Victory Condition: All monsters are eliminated and the carrot is still alive (with ten health points).
Defeat Condition: The monsters reach the carrot and the carrot's health points are depleted.

II. Architecture Analysis
Map Module: Contains information about the paths where monsters walk. Provides obstacles and tower building locations according to the level design. Attacking obstacles with turrets can obtain gold coins.
Monster Module: Different types of monsters have different speeds, health points, and resistances.
Defense Tower Module: There are multiple types of towers (such as slowdown towers, area attack towers, single high-damage towers). Towers can be upgraded to increase attack power or range.
Resource System: Players obtain gold coins by defeating monsters, and the gold coins are used to build and upgrade towers.
Level Logic: Each level has different waves of monsters, gradually increasing the difficulty.
Stage 1: Preparation stage. Players choose the placement positions of towers and formulate strategies.
Stage 2: Battle stage. Monsters are generated in waves and towers automatically attack monsters.
Stage 3: Settlement stage. After the player wins or loses, the score and rewards are counted, and the player proceeds to the next level or restarts the challenge.
Technical Implementation
Map: Implemented based on a two-dimensional grid, including tower building locations and path planning.
Monster Path: Monsters move along the preset path.
Defense Tower Attack: Calculate the collision detection of monsters within the range and reduce the health points of monsters.


II. Architecture Analysis / Game Characters
Defense Towers: There are many types of defense towers in the game, such as the attacking bottle tower, magic ball tower, the area damage fan tower, rocket tower, the control type ice star, slowdown gear, etc. Each type of defense tower has a unique appearance, attack method, and upgrade effect. Players need to select and combine them according to different monsters and scene requirements.
Monsters: There are a rich variety of monster types, including small minions with fast speed but low health points, large monsters with high health points but slow movement, as well as flying monsters with special skills, self-destructing monsters, etc.
Obstacles: Each level map will have different obstacles, such as stones, trees, boxes, etc. Each obstacle has different health points (the time required to eliminate the obstacle by attacking). Eliminating obstacles will yield corresponding gold coins or item rewards.
Other Characters: The carrot is the target that players need to protect. The carrot has different skins and shapes.

III. Innovation Points
Monster movement posture animation simulation, turret attack process simulation, monster being attacked and losing health simulation, etc.
Graphics: Each level map has a unique theme and style, such as forest, desert, ocean, etc.
Sound Effects: Defense towers' attacks, monsters' being injured and dying have corresponding sound effects. At the same time, different scenes are accompanied by different background music.
Level System: There are a large number of levels with gradually increasing difficulty. Each level has different terrains, monster combinations, and mission objectives, such as protecting a certain number of carrots, eliminating all monsters within a specified time, etc.
Item System: Various items can be collected and used in the game, such as bombs, slowdown potions, etc. Items can also be purchased with in-game currency.
Development System: Gold coins can be used to upgrade defense towers to improve their attack power, range, attack speed and other attributes.
Strategy: Players need to reasonably plan the placement positions of different types of defense towers according to the map terrain and monster movement paths. At the same time, they need to reasonably allocate resources to build and upgrade defense towers.
