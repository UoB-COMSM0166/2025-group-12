# Meeting Record January 30, 2025

- Evaluate the two groups' paper prototypes, identify similarities and differences, and determine which design elements should be integrated.
- **Discuss the game's world building, narrative themes, and art style.**
- **Initial planning of the technical requirements for digital development and potential technical challenges.**

## **Discussion Summary:**

The purpose of this discussion was to integrate the two game subplot concepts proposed in the last meeting (meeting records 2025/1/28). The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will feature a **turn-based strategy** game that centers around plant cultivation and wasteland restoration as its core mechanics.

1. The game is divided into a “Cultivation System” and a “Combat System,” interconnected through a “Reward Mechanism.”
    - The integration between the cultivation and reward systems, as well as the combat and reward systems, will be simulated and refined during the later stages of development.
    - The game will adopt a top-down perspective, eliminating the need for an in-game player avatar.
    1. **Cultivation System:** Serves as the resource accumulation process, focused on restoring degraded lands (referred to as “green zones”). Resources accumulate each turn, forming the foundation for restoring subsequent areas.
        - Each type of plant corresponds to a specific type of degraded land, necessitating the creation of a detailed plant database.
    2. **Combat System:** Acts as the primary resource expenditure mechanism, with natural disasters as the adversaries.
        - Implemented as a turn-based strategy, focusing on defending against natural disasters; enemies are anthropomorphized as disaster-themed creatures.
2. The game’s success condition is defined by the complete restoration of all degraded areas within the world.
3. **Software Development:**
    - The development process will be divided into tasks, which will be reviewed and confirmed in subsequent task overview sessions.
4. **Control Mechanics:**
    - Primary interactions via mouse, with keyboard as auxiliary input.
5. **Art Style:** Inspired by “Ink Wash Painting” (referencing *The Scroll of Rivers and Mountains*).
6. **Worldbuilding:** Incorporates themes of natural disasters, land restoration, and the principles of elemental interaction.
7. **Paper Prototype Development:** Once the specific in-game units are finalized, the paper prototype can be initiated.

### (中文)

本次討論為確定上次討論提出（meeting records 2025/1/28）的提出的兩個遊戲支線概念進行整合，目前最小可行性產品確定以**戰棋式回合制**遊戲來實現植物種植與失地復原的遊戲主軸。

1. 遊戲切割為“種植系統”與“戰鬥系統”，這兩個系統，透過“獎勵機制”來實現兩個系統的串聯
    - 種植系統與獎勵系統的串聯、戰鬥系統與獎勵系統的串聯，等待由後期的調適進行模擬整合
    - 直接以上帝視角進行遊戲，無需創建遊戲中玩家的投影
    1. 種植系統扮演：資源累積的過程，已經確定修復的失地（以「綠地」代稱），每個回後能夠累積資源，成為推動下一個區域修復的資源基礎
        - 每種植物對應著適合的失地屬性 ⇒ 需要建立相關的植物具體細節資料庫
    2. 戰鬥系統：作為資源消耗的主要原因，敵方為天然災害
        - 以戰棋回合制實現，主要在抵禦天然災害 ⇒ 敵方這個概念，以災害擬怪化實現
2. 遊戲的最終成功條件判定為，將世界中所有區域的失地進行修復
3. 軟體開發：
    - 將開發軟體開發過程進行任務切割 ⇒ 待進行任務瀏覽確認後
4. 具體操作細節：
    - 由滑鼠進行主要操作，鍵盤為輔助操作
5. 美術風格：《江南百景圖》，水墨風格
6. 世界觀：包含自然災害、失地修復、以及屬性相剋原理
7. 紙上原型（Paper Prototype）製作：待遊戲中具體（植物及災害間的關係）單位確認後，即可開始著手進行紙上原型製作

## **Meeting Agenda**

1. Discuss and finalize game ideas for the project.
2. Define the tone and core gameplay mechanics for game development.
3. Explore feasible implementation methods based on current resources.

## Discussion Summary

1. **Introduction of Game Ideas**:
    - Two potential game ideas were proposed and discussed during the meeting.
    - A team member demonstrated their prior experience in developing a simple game called "[Crow Hitting](https://redial17.github.io/jspractice/)," following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c).

    - Building upon ideas discussed in the previous meeting (January 14, 2025), the team explored implementing concepts inspired by *Stardew Valley*.
    - **Implementation Suggestion**: Focus on recreating specific scenes or mechanics instead of the entire game.
        - Given the capabilities of **p5.js**, dynamic backgrounds and scene transitions could be implemented using techniques such as scene switching or moving background images.
3. **Proposed Game Ideas**:
    - **Game Idea 1: Mole Manor (Simulation Game)**
        - **Concept**: A simulation game combining multiple mini-games, such as resource gathering, combat, and management, with the goal of upgrading a farm estate to Level 10.
        - **Core Gameplay**:
            - Players can pursue three branching paths:
                1. **Haunted House**: Catch ghosts in a cemetery using special tools and solve puzzles to capture powerful ghosts. (Risk: Debuffs from curses.)
                2. **Tourism**: Build a cozy estate for visitors.
                3. **Farming**: Plant crops, sell produce, and purchase materials to repair and upgrade the estate. (Risk: Debuffs from exhaustion.)
            - **Endgame Conditions**:
                - Bankruptcy, illness, or being caught by a ghost.
    - **Game Idea 2: Tower Defense + Survival (Story Game)**
        - **Concept**: A hybrid game inspired by *Plants vs. Zombies* and a fantastical creature collection theme.
        - **Core Gameplay**:
            - Incorporates tower defense mechanics with survival elements and features a collectible creature or resource guidebook.

# Meeting Record January 16, 2025

### Discussion Summary

This meeting focused on assigning team members to select their preferred game options (based on the options listed in the presentation) for research. Each member is tasked with compiling their research findings and personal reflections into a **report**. These reports will serve as the basis for deciding the theme, game type, and game elements for development.

**Deadline:** Please upload your report to **Github** by Sunday.

### Development Strategy

The current idea is to build upon the mechanics of existing games, and then add new elements and features. This approach aims to streamline the development process and avoid unnecessary complexity.

Additionally, all members are encouraged to explore the limitations of using **p5.js** for game development. It is recommended to visit [**p5play**](https://p5play.org/play/) to review examples of games developed with p5.js and gain inspiration from others' projects.

---

# Meeting Record January 14, 2025

The discussion's primary focus was on team members' past gaming experiences and the game elements they hope to incorporate. The proposed elements are as follows:

1. Developing the game with an RPG framework as the core.
2. Reference games include:
    - **Pokemon** (monster mechanics),
    - **Rusty Lake** (puzzle-solving and escape room elements),
    - **Stardew Valley** (farming, market economy, and more complex economic models).
3. Additional elements under consideration:
    - Chinese-style horror,
    - Romance.

The **prototype** is expected to be presented during the midterm evaluation, which is scheduled for one month from now. The current approach uses **Stardew Valley** as the foundational layer, with plans to gradually integrate other elements later.

Currently, the primary focus is on game programming, particularly learning **`p5.js`**, implementing in-game interactions, and managing function calls between different modules. Additional features, such as battles, romance, and puzzles, will be refined and integrated during the storyline development phase.
