## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?


  Our game is turn-based chessboard strategic, focusing on the flexibility and diversity of game strategy, along with resource management. The elements of the game is stacked up gradually, making it easy to understand and learn but hard as the game stages advance since elements are interwined with each other, so player need to raise a good strategy to clear the game. The background story of our game is about reconstructing world of wasteland destroyed by natural disasters. Various vegetation, which grown up from seeds some turns after planting, is our 'chess' to fight against disasters. As plants they are unable to move around on the chessboard, but they can acquire various skills and become stronger once they are cultivated closely to each other to form an ecosystem. When a game stage is cleared, all living plants will be transfered to player's inventory and available for later stages, so player need to carefully plan all movements.


### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop? 

### Design

- 15% ~750 words 
- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams. 

### Implementation

- 15% ~750 words

- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game.


Epic:
  Provide challenge to whom is interested in strategy games

stories & criteria:
  1. As a new player, I want to change difficulty of the game so that I can understand the game quickly.
     Given I have no previous strategy game experience, when I play the starting several stages, then I can get use to the gameplay.
  2. As a hard-core player, I want the game to be joyful and challengable so that I can enjoy the game.
     Given I have cleared the story mode of the game and fully enjoyed, when I want some extra challenge, then the game provides an infinite mode and other game modes.
  3. As a freshman in an art-related major, I want to understand how artistic concepts are projected into games so that I can expand the possibilities and scope of my artistic applications.
  4. As an aesthetically conscious individual without an art background, I want to gain insights into specific art-related knowledge through gameplay experiences so that I can construct my own perspective on artistic systems.
  5. As an art educator (advocate), I want to introduce the composition of various artistic style elements through multiple platforms so that my audience can concretely understand the practical applications of art.

  6. As a natural plant lover, and I want to have a plant-centered game that provides in-depth and rich plant knowledge, as well as some of the actual plant functions. So I hope the game has a complete and detailed illustration function.
     Given a extra plant illustrations, when players click each picture, 
     then it will shows the plant prototype, family, genus, species, suitable planting environment, growth cycle, medicinal value, economic value.
  7. As an environmental enthusiast, I want the game to simulate real-life planting experiences with diverse environments and climate systems, so that I can experience the challenges and excitement of randomness in plant cultivation.
     Given a randomized weather system integrated into the game, when a tactical board game starts and a weather condition is randomly selected (e.g., sunny, rainy, windy, drought, frost), 
     then the selected weather should provide corresponding buffs or debuffs that directly affect the growth attributes of plants in the current game session (e.g., growth speed, health, resilience, or yield).  


### Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

- One qualitative evaluation (your choice) 

- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice) 

- Description of how code was tested. 

### Process 

- 15% ~750 words

- Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together. 

### Conclusion

- 10% ~500 words

- Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work. 

### Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent. 

### Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be marking you on the following two points:

- **Quality** of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%) 
  - Please write in a clear concise manner suitable for an interested layperson. Write as if this repo was publicly available.

- **Documentation** of code (5%)

  - Is your repo clearly organised? 
  - Is code well commented throughout?
