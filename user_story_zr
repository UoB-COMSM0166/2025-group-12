Epic:
  Provide challenge to whom is interested in strategy games

stories & criteria:
  1. As a new player, I want to change difficulty of the game so that I can understand the game quickly.
     Given I have no previous strategy game experience, when I play the starting several stages, then I can get use to the gameplay.
  2. As a hard-core player, I want the game to be joyful and challengable so that I can enjoy the game.
     Given I have cleared the story mode of the game and fully enjoyed, when I want some extra challenge, then the game provides an infinite mode and other game modes.
  3. As a freshman in an art-related major, I want to understand how artistic concepts are projected into games so that I can expand the possibilities and scope of my artistic applications.
  4. As an aesthetically conscious individual without an art background, I want to gain insights into specific art-related knowledge through gameplay experiences so that I can construct my own perspective on artistic systems.
  5. As an art educator (advocate), I want to introduce the composition of various artistic style elements through multiple platforms so that my audience can concretely understand the practical applications of art.
