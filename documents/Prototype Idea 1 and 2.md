# Idea 1: Green Renaissance (Main)

“Green Renaissance” our first prototype idea is a strategic card game that combines resource management and ecological restoration. Players aim to revitalize a desolate through cleaning, planting, resource management, and addressing ecological threats, ultimately achieving complete ecological restoration. There are three major mechanisms, including a resource management system, an adventure system and a card reward system. They interweave the whole structure of this game.

1. Resource Management System
    
    This system has four main phrase: land reclamation phase, planting and cultivation phase, ecological restoration phase and sustainable development phase. Each phrase exemplifies the core idea of this game.
    
    - **land reclamation phase:** Clear debris and restore soil to create planting conditions.
    - **planting and cultivation phase:** Use cards, which are the reward from the assignments, to plant various types of vegetation with differing ecological contributions.
    - **ecological restoration phase:** Attract wildlife as vegetation recovers, gradually restoring the ecosystem.
    - **sustainable development phase:** Main ecological balance and ensure sustainable resource utilization.
2. Adventure System
    
    This is the main source of consuming resources collected by players. In the game, players need to make good use of their plants to neutralize the influence of disasters, such as a floods, earthquakes, or tsunamis.
    
    - **natural disasters:** e.g., drought reduces water resources, heavy rain affects plant growth.
    - **ecological opportunities:** e.g., “fertile land” accelerates plant growth, “wildlife aid” provides extra defense.
    - **pollution outbreaks:** e.g., garbage tides, toxic gas leaks affect the ecosystem.
    - **event triggers:** random triggers each round increase game challenge and variability.
3. Card Reward System
    
    The card reward system serves as a bridge between resource management system and adventure system. This is the major distinction between our game and the real-time strategy. Players need to collect the cards to develop in the next stage, such as players might need to use the **resources cards** to restoring the new area. As we discussed, there are five types of card in Green Renaissance.
    
    - **plant cards:** for planting herbs, shrubs, trees, each with unique ecological value.
    - **skill cards:** e.g., “accelerated growth”, “pest control,” to help players face challenges.
    - **tool cards:** upgrade tools to improve land reclamation and efficiency.
    - **event cards:** randomly triggered opportunities or challenges.
    - **ecological cards:** attract wildlife and improve the environment, such as “bee pollination”, “bird nesting”.

In our prototype idea, “Green Renaissance” is not only a strategic management game but also an immersive experience that integrates ecological education. The game emphasizes the dynamic balance of ecosystems while incorporating card mechanics to enhance playability. We aim to design this game in the form of a turn-based strategy game, which provides spaces that make player consider which strategy they desire. Through proper planning, players can understand the complexity and importance of ecosystems.

# Idea 2: Codex Guardians

“Codex Guardians” is the other prototype idea we discussed, it combines resources management, strategic operations, and defensive combat. The main purpose of players is to protect the “Codex”, a symbol of civilization, from monster invasions while continuously upgrading the city. Players begin with a limited city and accumulate resources through planting, mining, and praying, allocating the resources to balance economic development and military defense. The core mechanisms in this game, including: resource management, defensive construction and boss battles.

1. Resources Management
    
    In this game, there are three resource types: food, magic stones, and gold. Each of resources can be collected through specific ways.
    
    - **food:** Acquiring from farming. Food can increase population, train and recruit new rookies to the military.
    - **magic stones:** Acquiring from praying and mining. Magic stones are the most rare resource in the game. Most of them can be retrieved from magicians’ praying and some of them can be acquired from mining, accidentally.
    - **gold:** Acquiring from mining only. It can purchase buildings, escalate army quality, and unlock advanced technologies.
2. Defensive Construction
    
    There are three kinds of constructions to protect the Codex.
    
    1. **City walls:** Primary defensive structure with high durability, repairable with minerals, magic stones, and food.
    2. **Fences:** Frontline barriers that slow Boss advancement, repairable with minerals.
    3. **Watchtowers:** Exclusive attack platforms for magicians and artillery with low durability, repairable with magic stones and gold.

Comparing to Green Renaissance, Codex Guardians is more like a RTS, real-time strategy, game. However, the latter one focus on strategy heavily, which might be monotonous. Furthermore, considering the applicabilities and the developing feasibilities of our teams, Green Renaissance is the idea we decide to start the digital development.
