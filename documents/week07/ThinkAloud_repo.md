## **Test Objectives**

The purpose of this usability test is to evaluate the **intuitiveness and logical interaction** of the game, focusing on two key tasks:

1. **Is the gameplay intuitive?** Can players quickly understand the game's objectives, mechanics, and controls?
2. **Are in-game interactions logical?** Do the UI, interactions, and feedback align with player expectations?

## **Test Results & Participant Feedback**

### **Task 1: Is the Gameplay Intuitive?**

**Player Feedback:**

1. **When opening the game, players don't know what kind of game it is** (lack of **game title, background introduction, and gameplay instructions**).
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Add an **introduction or tutorial** to help players understand the game's setting and objectives.
2. **"Is this Latin?"** – Some text or terminology **feels inconsistent, leading to confusion**.
    - **Suggested Improvement**: Improve the game's **language localization and maintain terminology consistency**.
3. **Players are unsure if the first level has ended** (no **clear level completion indication**).
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Add **a clear level completion message**, such as “Level 1 Complete! Click to continue.”
4. **Numbers on the interface are unclear** in meaning.
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Provide **tooltip descriptions or tutorial explanations** for numerical values.


###  **Task 2: Are In-Game Interactions Logical?**

**Player Feedback:**

1. **No reward after successfully defending against enemies.**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Give players **feedback and rewards** (such as coins, experience points, or visual effects) to enhance the sense of achievement.
2. **"Why can't I move this tree?"**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: If trees are fixed objects, explain this **in the tutorial or UI hints**.
3. **"Why did items increase when I entered the warehouse?"**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Add **visual feedback or a log message** to explain inventory changes.
4. **"Why did the tornado disappear? Is this a bug?"**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Add **visual or text feedback**, such as “The storm has dissipated” or an animation effect.
5. **Players are unsure when they can plant trees.**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Add **guidance**, such as "You can plant trees after X turns" or highlight the plant button when it's available.
6. **Unclear differences between different tree types.**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Display **descriptions of different tree abilities** in the planting menu.
7. **Enemies and player units are difficult to distinguish, and the function of the lumberjack is unclear.**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Adjust **color schemes, outlines, or labels** to help players distinguish between units.
8. **Hints are not obvious, and players struggle to find important information.**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Improve hint placement, such as using **dynamic guidance or a more visible UI prompt**.
9. **The meaning of "Turn" is unclear—should players eliminate enemies or tornadoes?**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Provide a **clear description of turn objectives** in the UI.
10. **Skill combinations are not intuitive, and stamina/action bars are unclear. The "Seed" mechanic lacks explanation.**
    -  **Suggested Improvement**: Add a **skill demonstration or tutorial** to help players understand different mechanics.


## **Key Findings & Major Areas for Improvement**

### **Major Issues Identified:**

- **Lack of UI prompts** : Need to improve **tutorials, guidance, and UI feedback**.
- **Unclear interaction logic** : Need to enhance **visual and textual feedback for game mechanics**.
- **Players are unsure about the game objectives** : Need to reinforce **goal explanations through UI enhancements**.

### **Suggested Improvements:**

1. **Improve UI design to enhance readability and intuitiveness** (adjust colors, labels, and tooltips).
2. **Add tutorial guidance to help players understand game mechanics.**
3. **Enhance interaction feedback through animations, sounds, and visual effects.**
4. **Make game hints more noticeable** (optimize placement and use dynamic visual guidance).


## **Conclusion**

This usability test highlights issues related to **game intuitiveness and interaction logic**, primarily **a lack of guidance, unclear feedback, and insufficient information clarity**. By improving **UI design, tutorial elements, and interaction feedback**, the overall gameplay experience can be significantly enhanced.
