### **關鍵問題與優先處理建議**

### **最高優先處理（Severity ≥ 3.67）**

1. **遊戲直觀性嚴重不足，核心機制不明確（4.00）→ 建議**：增加更清晰的遊戲引導，透過視覺提示與新手教程降低學習曲線。
2. **第二關第二回合才顯示體力條（4.00）→ 建議**：在教學階段或第一關開始時，就顯示並解釋體力條的用途。
3. **天災、敵人方向邏輯不清晰（4.00）→ 建議**：透過動畫或圖示標示敵人方向，提高戰略判斷的可預測性。
4. **資源數字（Magic Number）無明確意義（3.67）→ 建議**：提供更直觀的數字標示（如單位、效果），讓玩家能理解數據意涵。
5. **教學關卡與正式關卡難度差異過大（3.67）→ 建議**：調整教學關卡難度，讓玩家有更自然的適應過程。

### **次要修正（Severity 3.00 - 3.33）**

1. **勝利條件未多元化，可能影響可玩性（3.00）→ 建議**：增加不同過關條件，如時間限制、生態恢復目標等，提升遊戲策略選擇。
2. **遊戲提示與備註未分開，影響可讀性（3.00）→ 建議**：分離提示與備註資訊，使遊戲內提示不會與遊戲進行資訊混淆。
3. **點擊植物後無法更換，影響操作流暢性（3.00）→ 建議**：允許玩家在一定時間內撤回或更改選擇，提高操作靈活性。
4. **遊戲有機率自動跳過第一回合，影響策略體驗（4.00）→ 建議**：確認 Bug，確保所有回合操作都是由玩家觸發。
5. **回合撤回功能缺失（4.00）→ 建議**：允許玩家回撤至少一步操作，避免策略錯誤導致挫敗感。

## **Heuristic Evaluation of Strategy Game Prototype: Integrating SUS and NASA-TLX**

This study assessed a strategy game prototype using the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** and **NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)** with 12 participants completing both easy and hard scenarios. Data revealed suboptimal usability and elevated cognitive load in complex tasks, with actionable insights for design iteration.

## **1. System Usability Scale (SUS)**

The SUS (10-item Likert scale converted to 0–100) yielded:

- **Easy scenario: 39.17**, **Hard scenario: 34.58**, both below the industry benchmark of 68 (Bangor et al., 2008)[2](https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1948&context=jaaer).
- **Critical items**:
    - Q3 ("Easy to use") and Q7 ("Quick to learn") scored lowest (easy=2.58, hard=2.42), indicating opaque core mechanics[1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measuring-perceived-usability/).
    - Q4 ("Technical support") and Q10 ("Learning effort") exceeded 3.6 in hard scenarios, highlighting steep learning curves.
- **Individual variance**: Maximum SUS=82.5 (hard) vs. minimum=5 (hard), suggesting UI guidance inadequately bridges skill gaps.

## **2. NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)**

NASA-TLX subscales (0–20) analysis showed

| **Dimension** | **Easy** | **Hard** | **Δ** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mental Demand | 8.17 | 13.17 | +61% ▲▲ |
| Effort | 6.67 | 12.83 | +92% ▲▲ |
| Frustration | 6.58 | 9.33 | +42% ▲ |

Total workload increased by 60% in hard scenarios (55.08 vs. 34.50), driven by strategic complexity.

## **3. Design Optimization Matrix**

Cross-analysis informed four priority improvements:

| **Issue Area** | **Specific Flaw** | **Design Solution** | **Expected Impact (SUS/NASA-TLX)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Learning Curve | High Q4/Q10 scores | Contextual tutorials + dynamic hints | SUS ▲ ; TLX ▼ |
| UI Clarity | Undefined magic numbers | Real-time labels + UI highlighting | SUS ▲ ; TLX ▼ |
| Strategy Transparency | Unpredictable paths | Path arrows + victory condition cues | TLX frustration ▼ |
| Control Feedback | No undo mechanism | Turn rollback + disaster rewards | TLX effort ▼ |

## **4. Academic Implications and Limitations**

This study validates SUS and NASA-TLX as complementary tools: SUS identifies global usability issues, while NASA-TLX pinpoints load sources (e.g., mental demand)[3](https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/assessment-individuals-systems-thinking-skills/docview/2544531417/se-2). Limitations include small sample size (n=12) and uncontrolled player backgrounds, necessitating larger cohorts and eye-tracking validation in future work[2](https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1948&context=jaaer).
