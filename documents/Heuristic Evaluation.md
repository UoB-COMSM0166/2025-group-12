### **關鍵問題與優先處理建議**

### **最高優先處理（Severity ≥ 3.67）**

1. **遊戲直觀性嚴重不足，核心機制不明確（4.00）→ 建議**：增加更清晰的遊戲引導，透過視覺提示與新手教程降低學習曲線。
2. **第二關第二回合才顯示體力條（4.00）→ 建議**：在教學階段或第一關開始時，就顯示並解釋體力條的用途。
3. **天災、敵人方向邏輯不清晰（4.00）→ 建議**：透過動畫或圖示標示敵人方向，提高戰略判斷的可預測性。
4. **資源數字（Magic Number）無明確意義（3.67）→ 建議**：提供更直觀的數字標示（如單位、效果），讓玩家能理解數據意涵。
5. **教學關卡與正式關卡難度差異過大（3.67）→ 建議**：調整教學關卡難度，讓玩家有更自然的適應過程。

### **次要修正（Severity 3.00 - 3.33）**

1. **勝利條件未多元化，可能影響可玩性（3.00）→ 建議**：增加不同過關條件，如時間限制、生態恢復目標等，提升遊戲策略選擇。
2. **遊戲提示與備註未分開，影響可讀性（3.00）→ 建議**：分離提示與備註資訊，使遊戲內提示不會與遊戲進行資訊混淆。
3. **點擊植物後無法更換，影響操作流暢性（3.00）→ 建議**：允許玩家在一定時間內撤回或更改選擇，提高操作靈活性。
4. **遊戲有機率自動跳過第一回合，影響策略體驗（4.00）→ 建議**：確認 Bug，確保所有回合操作都是由玩家觸發。
5. **回合撤回功能缺失（4.00）→ 建議**：允許玩家回撤至少一步操作，避免策略錯誤導致挫敗感。
